Why is SDLC important?

Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.

Here are some benefits of SDLC:

    Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
    Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
    Improved risk management and cost estimation
    Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction
