## Project Description 
This repository hosts the group assignment for COMP2156 DevOps course, focusing on 
collaborative Git workflows, branching strategies, and CI/CD integration. 

## Setup Instructions 
1. First, have the leader create the initial directory on their local machine.
2. Using the git init command, create the repository on GitHub so that the other members can clone the main branch.
3. Have each member clone the main repository on their local machine. 
4. Have each member create their own branch using `git checkout STUDENTID-Name`. 
5. Install any dependencies as listed.  

## CI/CD Pipeline 
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined 
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. 

## Branching Strategy 
Each team member works on a personal branch named `STUDENTID-Name`. Changes are integrated into the `main` 
branch through Pull Requests.
